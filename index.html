        <p1>Code: console.log(23 + 97);
            console.log(23+97+33+27+13+57);
            console.log((4 + 6 + 9) / 77);
            let a = 10;
            console.log(a); // Should print 10
            console.log(9 * a); // Multiplies `a` by 9
            let b = 7 * a;
            console.log(b); // Prints the result of `b`
            const MAX = 57;
            let actual = MAX - 13;
            let percentage = actual / MAX;
            console.log(percentage);<p1/>

        <p3>Knowledge questions:
            1. What are the three ways to declare a variable in JavaScript? Var, Const, Let.
2. Why should you avoid using var and prefer let or const ? Var has no block scope.
3. What are the rules for naming variables in JavaScript? Basically just use names that describe what they are and don't use single letters.
4. Describe what happens when you add numbers and strings together in JavaScript. It merges them.

5. How does the Modulo (%) operator work? It gives you the remainder.
6. Explain the difference between == and === . == is equal === is not equal
7. Under what circumstances would you receive a NaN result? When the answer is not a number.
8. How do you increment and decrement a number in JavaScript? ++ or --
9. How do you access developer tools and the console in a web browser? inspect a website and go to the console tab
10. How do you log information to the console in JavaScript? console.log()
11. What does the unary plus operator do to string representations of integers (e.g., +"10" )? Unary + does something different.
